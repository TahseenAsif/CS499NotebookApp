**Text Editor**
  Basics of it is done, waiting on database to finish up to connect them together to save notes.

**Layout of App**
  Basic frontend layout of the app, it is subject to change based on styling we agree on. Has functional buttons such as adding new notebook but still waiting on database to finish to connect them
